SmallRig Universal Mobile Phone Cage 2791B

SmallRig Universal Mobile Phone Cage 2791B  is a perfect cage for vlogging, live streaming, and mobile filmmaking. It works perfectly with most mobile phone models  in the market and will be compatible with mobile phones in a width range from 57mm to 90mm, with or without an outer case. It’s a screw tighten instead of the pressure fit, which will provide a more stable clamping effect. It features four  cold shoe mounts for a microphone and a LED light. Multiple 1/4 threaded holes can be used to attach a tripod, a top handle, or  a side handgrip. The 1/4 threaded holes in the front can be used to attach the power bank holder, which enables clamping a power bank to the rig when a sustainable charging solution is required. It supports both horizontal shooting and vertical shooting. Inbuilt rubber pads help absorb shocks and prevent your phone from scratching. Two cable ties are attached, which can be used to sort out the messy data cord and microphone cord during shooting. It’s lightweight and easy to hold.

Note:

1. Please make sure to put and take out the mobile phone gently.

2. Prevent falling or collisions, which may cause damage to your phone.

3. To use the wireless charge function, please take your phone out of the cage.

SmallRig Drop-in HawkLock Universal mini Quick Release Plate and Clamp 3513C

SmallRig Drop-in HawkLock Universal mini Quick Release Plate and Clamp 3513C comprises a quick-release plate and a baseplate. The quick-release plate supports devices with 1/4""-20 threads, such as cameras, monitors, cages, mounting plates, etc.; the quick-release plate is reserved for 2 optional dowel pins, which can be removed and installed as needed to effectively prevent the devices from deflection.  Its 1/4""-20 threaded holes on the bottom allow attaching devices with 1/4""-20 screws, like tabletop tripods, ball heads, etc. It can buckle vertically and stably into the baseplate, causing no deflection. The whole kit, featuring a maximum dynamic load capacity of 5kg, is easy to lock and unlock for multiple shooting scenes. With built-in silicone pads on the top to prevent deflection and scratches.

Note:

1. In order to prevent accidental contact from causing unlocking, the structure of HawkLock Quick Release is designed to prevent accidental contact, and the wrench also has a certain free movement in the locked state. The situation mentioned above is not a quality problem without affecting normal use.

2. The dowel pins are only compatible with Atomos Ninja V, Ninja V +, and Atomos Shinobi 7; The dowel pins need to be removed when using other brands of monitors.

SmallRig x Potato Jet TRIBEX Hydraulic Carbon Fiber Tripod Kit (Origin Series) 4259

SmallRig x Potato Jet TRIBEX Hydraulic Carbon Fiber Tripod Kit (Origin Series) 4259 is designed for professional outdoor videography, offering swift and convenient operation. Featuring X-Clutch hydraulic technology, squeezing a single clutch allows all legs to rapidly unfold, adjust the angle, and automatically lock in just one second, providing photographers with a seamless experience. The clutch can also be adjusted to 45° and 90° to accommodate various shooting scenarios. Constructed with carbon fiber, both the legs and center column ensure lightweight design while delivering exceptional stability and high load-bearing capacity. Operating altitude ranges from 27cm (10.6in) to 168cm (66.1in), and a compact storage length of 79cm (31.1in). The center column features a quick-lock design for easy height adjustments, with a detachable Allen wrench built into the other side of the hook for convenient camera equipment assembly/disassembly, and the option for low-angle shooting at a minimum height of 27cm (10.6in). The compact design of the tripod allows it to fit in any standard luggage (28"").

The kit includes a compact and lightweight hydraulic fluid head featuring an adjustable 4-step counterbalance system. When the gravitational center height is set at 55mm (2.2 inches), the 4-step counterbalance system effectively stabilizes cameras or other equipment (up to 6kg / 13.2lbs) while providing precise control over camera tilt. The fluid head allows seamless, stepless adjustments for tilt and pan damping, catering to filmmakers' varying shooting preferences. The fluid head adopts a new Touch-and-Go quick-release mount plate design which does not require alignment and is more efficient than traditional slide-in plates. The plate is compatible with 501 quick-release plates and DJI RS series quick-release plates, facilitating swift transitions between stabilizers and tripods during filming. The user-friendly detachable telescopic handle enables easy control of the head when attached to either the left or right side, ensuring compatibility with any grip. The fluid head also features three 1/4""-20 threaded holes for attaching accessories like magic arms, along with a built-in flat head screw for convenient camera installation and removal. The tripod also includes quick-release rubber feet with integrated spikes, allowing for seamless adaptation to various terrains.

Note:

1. Before shooting, make sure the head and tripod locking status are in normal condition.

2. Avoid use in sandy or dusty environments to prevent the risk of damage.

3. After using the short center column, mounted on the center column, need to ensure the locking status.

4. Max payload of head: 6kg / 13.2lb (center column raised, leg angle at 23°, height at 168cm / 66.1in).

5. The weight capacity of the tripod head is not the absolute limit; it varies depending on the type of equipment, lenses used, accessories attached, and changes in the center of gravity.

6. Max payload of tripod: 25kg / 55lbs (center column not raised, tripod head detached, leg angle at 23°, height at 141cm / 55.5in).

7. After soaking in water, it needs to be dried before use.

The package includes an all-in-one magnetic suction cup, a rotating adapter, an action camera mount, and a mobile phone clamp. The 1/4""-20 screw on one end allows attaching an action camera, LED video light, etc. It can also be used with a mobile phone clamp to attach mobile phones with a width of 56-86mm / 2.2-3.4in and a thickness of less than 9mm / 0.4in. The included action camera mount supports GoPro Cage 3084C / 3083C, Frame for Insta360 X3 4088B, and DJI Action 4 Cage 4119B. Similar products from SmallRig include 3566, 4193, and other camera mount supports.

Note:

1. The package does not include a safety rope. Please bring your safety rope when using it for car photography at high speed. It is recommended to keep the speed below 120km/h (74mph) and check the suction force before use and every hour.

The unique adjustable clamp design of the matte box features a three-point locking system, allowing for quick assembly and disassembly by pressing the push rods on both sides of the clamp and a locking knob on top. With an adjustable clamp range of 67.0 - 82.0mm (2.6 - 3.2in), it offers broad compatibility with popular mirrorless and cinema lenses. With its slim design, it accommodates circular and square filters seamlessly, ensuring no vignetting at focal lengths ≥16mm (for full-frame cameras and lenses), reducing glare effectively in challenging conditions. Additionally, you can meet your diverse filter needs for video and photo shoots by selecting from optional CPL, ND (ID:4799), VND (ID:4649), Black Diffusion Filter Kit (ID:4650), and White Diffusion Filter Kit (ID:4652). Boasting a modular design, this matte box facilitates easy accessory assembly and disassembly in a mere 3 steps. Its sleek, lightweight build not only streamlines the process but also alleviates equipment weight, enhancing comfort during shoots.

Note:

1. Before use, remove the UV filter from the front of the lens.

2. Ensure the top locking knob is securely fastened before use; do not operate without the top knob being locked.

3. This matte box cannot be installed on mirrorless lenses with an outer diameter >88mm or cinema lenses with an outer diameter >85mm.

SmallRig Professional Fluid Head PH8 4287

SmallRig Professional Fluid Head PH8 4287 is a professional fluid head to facilitate video shooting. The fluid head features an adjustable 6-step counterbalance system.

The fluid head PH8 adopts a new Touch-and-Go quick-release mount plate design which does not require alignment and is more efficient than traditional slide-in plates. The user-friendly detachable telescopic handle allows rotation attaching it to both left and right sides, making it suitable for any grip. The Professional Fluid Head PH8 is lightweight, compact, and robust. It weighs only 1.8kg / 3.9lb, making it smaller than other similar products on the market.

SmallRig Carbon Fiber Tripod Kit FT-S303 4643

SmallRig Carbon Fiber Tripod Kit FT-S303 4643 is a carbon fiber tripod designed for professional outdoor videography. The legs feature a FreeSpeed-Twist quick-tightening design, allowing for easy and efficient setup by tightening double knobs to lock all three sections. Operating Altitude ranges from 27cm (10.6in) to 150cm (59.0in), and a compact storage length of 74cm (29.1in). The use of a 30mm diameter for the legs ensures a lightweight design without compromising stability and load-bearing capacity. This tripod, featuring a built-in bubble level, works with a 65mm bowl base for leveling and easy management of frame level. The kit includes a compact fluid head, featuring a damping system, that allows you to pan the camera smoothly. When its center of gravity height is put at 50mm, the panning, and pre-set fixed counterbalance system can help precisely control the camera or other rigs weighing up to 4kg for great counterbalance. The video head can carry as much as 6kg (13.2lb). It has a newly designed snap-on quick-release plate mount, a more efficient mounting solution than traditional slide-on ones, which is DJI RS series quick-release plate and 501PL quick-release plate compatible to realize a free switch between stabilizer shooting and tripod shooting. The kit also features 1/4""-20 and 3/8""-16 threaded holes for attaching accessories like magic arms, along with a built-in flat head screw for convenient camera installation and removal. It weighs only 2.9kg (6.4 lbs).

Note:

1. Before shooting, make sure the head and tripod locking status are in normal condition.

2. Avoid use in sandy or dusty environments to prevent the risk of damage.

3. Max payload of head: 6kg / 13.2lb (leg angle at 23°, height at 150cm / 59.0in).

4. The weight capacity of the tripod head is not the absolute limit; it varies depending on the type of equipment, lenses used, accessories attached, and changes in the center of gravity.

5. Max payload of tripod: 15kg / 33lbs ( Tripod head detached, leg angle at 23°, height at 140cm / 55.1in).

SmallRig RC 100B COB LED Video Light (Standard Version) 4893

SmallRig RC 100B COB LED Video Light (Standard Version) 4893 is the latest addition to SmallRig's  Portable COB LED Video Light Ecosystem. This new light features a consistent cubic design, and an efficient cooling system independently developed by SmallRig.  The palm-sized RC 100B COB LED video light is only one-third the size of a traditional COB LED video light and is very close to the RED KOMODO in size, weighing just 700g or 24.7oz. Its compact design allows for easy storage and transport, making it particularly suitable for on-the-go photography and video content creation.

The light supports a variety of wireless and wired power options. Users can opt for V-mount batteries or NP-F970 batteries for wireless power supply, charge the device through a USB-C port with accessories like battery grip handles, PD fast charging power bank and charging plug, or AC to DC power adaptor. A single 98Wh V mount battery provides about an hour of full power, enabling uninterrupted shooting with quick battery changes.

The light offers both wireless and manual control modes for efficient light management. Wireless light control can be achieved through the SmallGoGo application. It is also compatible with DMX wired control manually when used with a DMX adapter (sold separately). Additionally, manual adjustments are possible via a 1.3-inch LCD screen, which is complemented by two individual knobs on the side of the device.

The Chip-on-Board light source features a patented high Color Rendering Index (CRI) for exceptional illumination and color accuracy. At a distance of 1m / 39.4in, the bare light source provides illumination of 4,610Lux at 5600K, which can be increased to 20,100Lux with the 45° mini hyper reflector. With a CRI of 97+, TLCI of 98+, SSI (3200K) of 91, and TM-30 (3200K) Rf/ Rg reaching 97/102, the light offers professional color performance, precise calibration, and accurate reproduction of natural daylight.

The body is made of V-0 flame retardant PC+ABS and reinforced with metal parts at the base, reducing weight by 30% compared to full aluminum alloy bodies while ensuring durability for frequent use.

The light features built-in cool and warm light adjust, special effects adjust, and preset modes, allowing simulation of 2700K-6500K sunlight with 12 common special effects. It also supports 4 sets of preset parameters for quick access and application of specific lighting settings.

It comes with a comprehensive range of accessories, fully compatible with SmallRig's mini-mount modifiers (D30, D60, 45x45 softbox) / battery accessories (V mount and NP-F970 batteries, universal battery grip handle for COB lights) / mounting accessories (light stand adaptor, Bowen's mount adapter part, 1/4""-20 with ARRI locating pins magic arm), providing users with a one-stop solution for portability, convenient power supply, easy control, high-quality light source, and comprehensive accessory ecosystem.

Usage Scenarios: Ideal for content creation, including photography (anime Convention, event,  travel, and wedding photography) as well as video content creation (YouTube channel episodes, interviews, documentaries, music video production, TV commercials, and live streaming).

Note: After using the equipment, the COB LED beads, panel area, top, and bottom of the device are all high-temperature zones. Avoid touching these high-temperature areas before the device has cooled down. For your safety and well-being, do not block the heat dissipation holes while using this device, and avoid prolonged direct exposure to the COB LED beads during operation.

The all-metal construction of the cage provides comprehensive protection for your phone, aiding in shock absorption and safeguarding against scratches. The set enables the phone to be used without the case for underwater shooting or high-performance cooling, securely housed within the cage alongside the TPU soft frame.

Note: The phone case width is 75.6mm / 2.97in. When using a third-party phone case with the cage, ensure accurate measurements for compatibility.

SmallRig RC 100C COB LED Video Light (Ink Blue / Lite Version) 5377

SmallRig RC 100C COB LED Video Light is the latest addition to SmallRig's Portable RGBWW COB LED Video Light Ecosystem. This innovative light features a sleek cubic design and an efficient in-house cooling system. Compact and lightweight, the palm-sized RC 100C is only one-third the size of traditional COB LED lights, closely resembling the RED KOMODO, and weighs just 710g (25oz). This design facilitates easy storage and transport, making it ideal for on-the-go shooting.

Equipped with a Chip-on-Board light source, the RC 100C boasts a patented high Color Rendering Index (CRI) for exceptional illumination and color accuracy. At a distance of 1m (39.4in), it delivers 3,650 Lux at 5600K, which can be boosted to 11,000 Lux with the 45° mini reflector. With a CRI of 96+, a TLCI of 98+, an SSI (3200K) of 84, and TM-30 (3200K) Rf / Rg values of 94/102, this light ensures professional-grade color rendering and accurate reproduction of natural daylight. It also features cool and warm light options, HSI mode, RGBCW mode, special effects, and GEL modes, simulating sunlight from 2500K to 10000K with 12 special effects. Users can quickly access four sets of preset parameters for specific lighting settings.

Control options include wireless operation through the SmallGoGo app or DMX wired control with a separate adapter. Manual adjustments are facilitated by a 1.44-inch LCD color screen and two independent knobs.

The light offers versatile power options, allowing for wireless operation with either V-mount or NP-F970 batteries. It can also be charged via a USB-C port using accessories such as a power handle, PD power bank, or charging cable, as well as an AC to DC power adapter.

Constructed from V-0 flame-retardant PC+ABS and reinforced with metal at the base, the light is 30% lighter than full aluminum alloy bodies while maintaining durability for frequent use.

A comprehensive range of accessories is included, fully compatible with SmallRig's mini-mount lighting modifiers (D30, D60, 45x45 softbox, SP-mini spotlight), battery accessories (V-mount and NP-F970 batteries, charging grip handles, NP-F battery plates), and mounting accessories (quick release light stand adapters, Bowens mount adapters, magic arms with 1/4""-20 ARRI locating pins). This provides users with a one-stop solution for portability, convenient power supply, easy control, high-quality light source, and a complete accessory ecosystem.

Usage Scenarios: Perfect for content creation, including photography at anime conventions, events, travel, and weddings, as well as video production for YouTube episodes, interviews, documentaries, music videos, TV commercials, and live streaming.

Note: After operation, the COB LED beads, panel area, and both the top and bottom of the device may become hot. To ensure safety, please refrain from touching these areas until they have cooled down. Additionally, avoid obstructing the heat dissipation holes during use, and do not stare directly at the COB LED beads for extended periods.

SmallRig RC 100C COB LED Video Light (Ink Blue / Pro Version / EU Plug) 5380

SmallRig RC 100C COB LED Video Light is the latest addition to SmallRig's Portable RGBWW COB LED Video Light Ecosystem. This innovative light features a sleek cubic design and an efficient integrated cooling system. Compact and lightweight, the palm-sized RC 100C is only one-third the size of traditional COB LED lights, closely resembling the RED KOMODO, and weighs just 710g (25oz). This design facilitates easy storage and transport, making it ideal for on-the-go shooting.

Equipped with a Chip-on-Board light source, the RC 100C boasts a patented high Color Rendering Index (CRI) for exceptional illumination and color accuracy. At a distance of 1m (39.4in), it delivers 3,650 Lux at 5600K, which can be boosted to 11,000 Lux with the 45° mini reflector. With a CRI of 96+, a TLCI of 98+, an SSI (3200K) of 84, and TM-30 (3200K) Rf/Rg values of 94/102, this light ensures professional-grade color rendering and accurate reproduction of natural daylight. It also features cool and warm light options, HSI mode, RGBCW mode, special effects, and GEL modes, simulating sunlight from 2500K to 10000K with 12 special effects. Users can quickly access four sets of preset parameters for specific lighting settings.

Control options include wireless operation through the SmallGoGo app or DMX wired control with a separate adapter. Manual adjustments are facilitated by a 1.44-inch LCD color screen and two independent knobs.

The light offers versatile power options, allowing for wireless operation with either V-mount or NP-F970 batteries. It can also be charged via a USB-C port using accessories such as a power handle, PD power bank, or charging cable, as well as an AC to DC power adapter.

Constructed from V-0 flame-retardant PC+ABS and reinforced with metal at the base, the light is 30% lighter than full aluminum alloy bodies while maintaining durability for frequent use.

A comprehensive range of accessories is included, fully compatible with SmallRig's mini-mount lighting modifiers (D30, D60, 45x45 softbox, SP-mini Spotlight), battery accessories (V-mount and NP-F970 batteries, charging grip handles, NP-F battery plates), and mounting accessories (quick release light stand adapters, Bowens mount adapters, magic arms with 1/4""-20 ARRI locating pins). This provides users with a one-stop solution for portability, convenient power supply, easy control, high-quality light source, and a complete accessory ecosystem.

Usage Scenarios: Perfect for content creation, including photography at anime conventions, events, travel, and weddings, as well as video production for YouTube episodes, interviews, documentaries, music videos, TV commercials, and live streaming.

Note: After operation, the COB LED beads, panel area, and both the top and bottom of the device may become hot. To ensure safety, please refrain from touching these areas until they have cooled down. Additionally, avoid obstructing the heat dissipation holes during use, and do not stare directly at the COB LED beads for extended periods.
