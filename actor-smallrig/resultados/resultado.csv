The battery features eight strategically placed ports: one BP port, two D-Tap ports, two USB-C ports (100W PD fast charging), one USB-A port, and two DC ports. Each port operates on an independent circuit, allowing multiple devices to charge simultaneously. The integrated BMS control chip guarantees rapid charging (fully charged in only two hours) and stable, safe power output.

At its core, the X99 utilizes premium LG battery cells, renowned for their exceptional cycle life and accurate battery readings. Innovative designs include dual mounting options (1/4"" & 3/8"" threaded holes) and a backlight indicator for effortless installation even in dim light. These professional-grade features combine to make the X99 an indispensable power solution for serious content creators.

SmallRig Magnetic UV Filter for FUJIFILM X half (Silver) 5392

SmallRig Magnetic UV Filter for FUJIFILM X half (Silver) 5392 is designed to protect camera lenses while maintaining optical performance. The filter securely attaches to camera lenses through four built-in magnets, providing reliable protection against bumps and scratches without the risk of accidental detachment.

Precision-engineered with CNC machining, this filter ensures zero vignetting. The optical glass lens features a multi-layer coating that achieves 99% light transmittance for accurate color reproduction, while its low surface reflectivity significantly reduces glare and ghosting.

Constructed from B270 optical glass with dual-sided multi-coating, the filter resists water splashes, oil stains, and scratches, making it easy to clean. The ultra-thin 5mm (0.2in) aluminum frame provides lightweight protection that is virtually unnoticeable during use.

For the silver frame version, the interior is finished with black paint to minimize glare from light reflections.

Note:

1. Clean the lens only with the included cleaning cloth.

SmallRig mini Follow Focus F40 3010C

SmallRig mini Follow Focus F40 3010C, with its exquisite and compact design, aims at providing precise and quick focus control for video shooting. It is made of new materials for optimized zoom control and features an anti-sweat, anti-slip focus knob (inspired by a sports car hub) to feel comfortable. In the box, there is Rod Clamp (with NATO rail) 3011, which can be easily locked to the side or the top of most cages via a 1/4”-20 screw to allow reversing the focus action; a lightweight Silicone Gear (3852), which, when working with the M0.8-43T gear, drives lens through friction, without applying a follow focus ring, shortening your rig list and simplifying installation; and an all-metal 15mm rod clamp with jib, which has improved rotation angle to support different lenses. Adjusting A/B stops helps quickly set the focal length you desire. Besides, a storage case is included for more convenience and portability.

Note:

1. The silicone gear is M0.8-43T compatible only.

2. To avoid gear slippage, please ensure the silicone gear fits tightly with the lens ring, particularly for large-damping zoom lenses.

3. The silicone gear only supports SLR / mirrorless lenses. Just remove it before using a cinema lens.

4. The snap-on follow focus gear ring supports the lens with a maximum diameter of 114 mm.

SmallRig ""Rhinoceros"" Basic Cage Kit for Sony Alpha 7R V / Alpha 7 IV / Alpha 7S III 3708

SmallRig ""Rhinoceros"" Basic Cage Kit for Sony Alpha 7R V / Alpha 7 IV / Alpha 7S III 3708  is designed to facilitate low-angle shooting, protect the camera, and provide accessory mounting points. The kit includes a cage, a top handle, and an HDMI cable clamp. Both the cage and the top handle are portable for being made of lighter carbon fiber, hence longer handheld shooting. For the cage, a locating pin, a 1/4""-20 screw, and an M2.5 screw together lock the camera firmly. It features a clean streamlined design that gives full access to the top buttons. The handle feels comfortable to carry and take a low-angle shot; and the HDMI cable clamp, tightened via a flat-head screw, protects  the interfaces to ensure stable signal transmission. Also, the kit comes with 1/4""-20 threaded holes for Monitor Mount 2294, cold shoes for the microphone, LED video light, and ARRI 3/8""-16 locating holes for Monitor Mount 2903B. A NATO rail and an Arca-Swiss quick-release plate add versatility to the cage. Particularly, the Arca-Swiss plate enables a quick switch between handheld, tripod, and gimbal (DJI RS 2 / RSC 2 / RS 3 / RS 3 Pro) modes.

Note:

1. Please remove the left split D-ring before installing the side lock adapter.

2. HDMI Cable Clamp interferes with the interface of the synchronous terminal when used on the Sony Alpha 7R V camera.

SmallRig MagEase Magnetic VND Filter ND2-ND32 (1-5 Stop) 52mm 4215

SmallRig MagEase Magnetic VND Filter ND2-ND32 (1-5 Stop) 52mm 4215 contains two CPLs, stacked and rotated to reduce the amount of light, thereby balancing the exposure time. Its inner polarizer magnetically mounts to the SmallRig filter adapter ring via a bottom locating ring, whereas the outer polarizer can be rotated via an aluminum alloy ring at 1-5 stop variations to reduce the amount of light.

Made of German Schott B270i HD glass, the filter features waterproof, stain-resistant, mildewproof, and scratch-resistant AR coatings, with less color cast, as well as a CNC-machined ultra-thin frame. Large-diameter filter prevents vignetting even in shooting using an ultra-wide angle lens. It can be magnetically and securely attached to SmallRig magnetic filter ring adapter via the bottom anti-deflection design and rotated between a range of hard stops at ND2 & ND32 for precise control of shooting.

SmallRig MagEase Magnetic CPL Filter (52mm) 4216

SmallRig MagEase Magnetic CPL Filter (52mm) 4216 can eliminate reflection from non-metallic surfaces (such as lakes, windows, waterfalls, glass, buildings, etc.) and thereby improve image saturation. Increased color saturation means a bluer sky and more transparent water. It can also be used as an ND filter, reducing light by 1-2 stops. To eliminate reflection, you just need to rotate the CPL filter properly.

Made of German Schott B270i HD glass, the filter features waterproof, stain-resistant, mildewproof, and scratch-resistant AR coatings, with less color cast, as well as a CNC-machined ultra-thin frame. No vignetting even in shooting using an ultra-wide angle lens. It can be magnetically and securely attached to SmallRig magnetic filter adapter ring.

Note:

1. Rotate the filter to eliminate reflection.

2. Not recommended for use in furious motion or in strong winds.

SmallRig Triple Magnetic Suction Cup Mounting Support Kit for Action Cameras 4468

SmallRig Triple Magnetic Suction Cup Mounting Support Kit for Action Cameras 4468 is designed to shoot car scenes using an action camera. It is only recommended to be used on flat iron surfaces, such as iron doors, railings, kitchenware, sports equipment, etc. The exclusive dual-material design combines magnets with a vacuum sucker, ensuring safer, longer-lasting, and more stable shooting. Even in the unlikely case of silicone suction cup leakage due to severe vibration, the magnets can pull the whole mounting support to the surface of an iron car (within the load capacity of 0.35kg / 0.8lb in a dynamic shooting scene with a flat road when maximum speed does not exceed 120km/h or 74mph), effectively avoiding the risk of falling off caused by the leakage of a silicone suction cup. The kit includes triple magnetic suction cups (one for each foot), a ball head, and an action camera mount. The 1/4""-20 screw on one end allows attaching an action camera, monitor, LED video light, microphone, etc., and the built-in spring pins support SmallRig 3084C, 3083C, 4088B, 4119B, and other accessories with locating holes to prevent deflection.  The rubber and silicone dual shock absorber design of the triple magnetic suction cup reduces shakes from dynamic shooting and improves picture stability.

Note:

1. The package does not include a safety rope. Please bring your safety rope when using it for car photography at high speed. It is recommended to keep the speed below 120km/h (74mph) and check the suction force before use and every hour.

The set includes a T-mount adapter ring for direct integration with the T-mount backplane on iPhone series cages. Equipped with the threaded adapter ring, the filter can be mounted on a 67mm camera lens, providing a convenient magnetic filter installation experience for camera lenses.

Note: 

1. While the filter design significantly reduces the occurrence of vignetting in photos, it does not guarantee the complete elimination of vignetting under all shooting conditions and camera settings.

2. The adapter is compatible with M-brand T-mount cages or cases and does not support FotorGear T-mount.

SmallRig Follow Focus F50 4745

SmallRig Follow Focus F50 4745 delivers precise focus control for video production. Its ingenious adjustable driving gap design eliminates backlash, ensuring a seamless focus experience. The one-touch stepless damping lever allows dynamic damping control within a range of 0.3kgf–1.0kgf, catering to diverse lens damping preferences, while 2-step A/B stop switching and 360° swift push-pull zoom enhance versatility.

Included is a silicone gear (ID 3852) that enables friction-driven focus for mirrorless lenses, along with a compact silicone handwheel for a non-slip grip and fine-tuned control. This follow focus mounts using a Φ15mm rod and a single rod clamp (ID 1549) on the left or top of the lens, with adjustable angles for flexible configurations. Its modular design ensures a quick and precise setup for handheld, tripod, and various shooting scenarios.

Note:

1. Ensure the silicone gear fits tightly with the lens ring. If slippage occurs with high-damping zoom lenses, check for looseness between the silicone gear and the lens.

SmallRig Neutral Density Filter Kit 4799

SmallRig Neutral Density Filter Kit 4799 is designed for users to capture scenes like waterfall cascades, sunrise, sunset, etc. This kit comprises ND8, ND64, and ND1000 filters.

SmallRig Matte Box Kit With CPL&VND Filters 5011

SmallRig Matte Box Kit With CPL&VND Filters 5011 is designed for mirrorless camera video shooting, maintaining depth of field while adjusting external light flux to preserve exposure balance and prevent glare and flares from sunlight or other strong light sources.

The VND filter frame features dual CPL+VND filter functionality with a magnetic attachment for various CPL and VND combinations. The VND features 2-5 stops with infinite adjustment.  Incorporated hard stop and light transmission limit technologies effectively eliminate VND cross patterns.

The filters utilize imported high-definition glass with a 22-layer dual-sided coating technology, providing highly accurate color reproduction and minimal color distortion within the 350-700nm wavelength range. Optional black diffusion filter kits (ID 4650, 4652) and ND filter kits (ID 4799) are available to meet all your needs.

The VND filter frame features an automatic locking system that can be quickly released with a single press.  With its lightweight and slim design and front-mounted lens compatibility, it achieves attaching ≥16mm focal length without vignetting (while using with full-frame camera and lens setups). This kit also includes four common threaded adapters (Φ67-95mm; Φ72-95mm; Φ77-95mm; Φ82-95mm) and a 4x5.65"" filter frame to cater to different lens and filter specifications.

Note:

1. Compatible only with ID 3556, 3645, 3641, 3646.

2. The filter frame's inner lens-mounted design is compatible with a wider range of focal lengths.

3. VND lacks explicit stop markings.

4. When combining CPL1 with CPL2/CPL3 to form VND, ensure alignment points are within the VND range line.

5. CPL filters, ND filters, and softboxes are directional and need to be installed with the logo facing outward.

SmallRig Modular Follow Focus F60 5163

SmallRig Modular Follow Focus F60 5163 is engineered for precise and smooth lens focus control during video shooting. Notably, its optimized core drive mechanism ensures zero-backlash focus tracking for exceptional accuracy. The innovative stepless damping adjustment allows dynamic damping control within a range of 0.6kgf-1.8kgf, catering to users' preferences for different lens damping levels. It also supports 3-step quick lens reversal switching and 2-step A / B stops setting and release, along with 360° quick push-pull zoom. This modular follow focus includes a silicon gear (ID: 3852) that directly drives focusing on mirrorless camera lenses through friction. Redesigned for a refined appearance, it offers improved damping adjustment and a wider range of focus angles, significantly enhancing the overall user experience.

Note:

1. Variations in wood grain color may occur compared to promotional images.

2. Ensure the silicone gear fits tightly with the lens ring. If slippage occurs with high-damping zoom lenses, check for looseness between the silicone gear and the lens.

3. The silicone gear is compatible only with DSLR and mirrorless lenses. Please remove it before using cinema lenses.

SmallRig Filter Kit for DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro / 4 5412

SmallRig Filter Kit for DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro / 4 5412 is specifically designed for the DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro and Action 4 cameras. Constructed from high-quality Rainbow high-alumina glass, these filters offer exceptional durability, with excellent impact resistance and scratch protection.

This kit includes a 1/4 black mist filter, an ND16 & CPL filter, a film simulation filter, a star-cross filter, and a silicone lens cover. The 1/4 black mist filter softens highlights for a dreamy, cinematic effect. The ND16 & CPL filter eliminates reflections while ensuring true color reproduction, making it ideal for landscape and architectural photography in bright conditions. The film simulation filter creates analog film tones, perfect for portraits, street photography, and vintage-style imagery. The star-cross filter transforms point light sources into dramatic 6-point starbursts during nighttime scenes.

SmallRig Universal Mobile Phone Cage 2791B

SmallRig Universal Mobile Phone Cage 2791B  is a perfect cage for vlogging, live streaming, and mobile filmmaking. It works perfectly with most mobile phone models  in the market and will be compatible with mobile phones in a width range from 57mm to 90mm, with or without an outer case. It’s a screw tighten instead of the pressure fit, which will provide a more stable clamping effect. It features four  cold shoe mounts for a microphone and a LED light. Multiple 1/4 threaded holes can be used to attach a tripod, a top handle, or  a side handgrip. The 1/4 threaded holes in the front can be used to attach the power bank holder, which enables clamping a power bank to the rig when a sustainable charging solution is required. It supports both horizontal shooting and vertical shooting. Inbuilt rubber pads help absorb shocks and prevent your phone from scratching. Two cable ties are attached, which can be used to sort out the messy data cord and microphone cord during shooting. It’s lightweight and easy to hold.

Note:

1. Please make sure to put and take out the mobile phone gently.

2. Prevent falling or collisions, which may cause damage to your phone.

3. To use the wireless charge function, please take your phone out of the cage.

SmallRig Drop-in HawkLock Universal mini Quick Release Plate and Clamp 3513C

SmallRig Drop-in HawkLock Universal mini Quick Release Plate and Clamp 3513C comprises a quick-release plate and a baseplate. The quick-release plate supports devices with 1/4""-20 threads, such as cameras, monitors, cages, mounting plates, etc.; the quick-release plate is reserved for 2 optional dowel pins, which can be removed and installed as needed to effectively prevent the devices from deflection.  Its 1/4""-20 threaded holes on the bottom allow attaching devices with 1/4""-20 screws, like tabletop tripods, ball heads, etc. It can buckle vertically and stably into the baseplate, causing no deflection. The whole kit, featuring a maximum dynamic load capacity of 5kg, is easy to lock and unlock for multiple shooting scenes. With built-in silicone pads on the top to prevent deflection and scratches.

Note:

1. In order to prevent accidental contact from causing unlocking, the structure of HawkLock Quick Release is designed to prevent accidental contact, and the wrench also has a certain free movement in the locked state. The situation mentioned above is not a quality problem without affecting normal use.

2. The dowel pins are only compatible with Atomos Ninja V, Ninja V +, and Atomos Shinobi 7; The dowel pins need to be removed when using other brands of monitors.

SmallRig x Potato Jet TRIBEX Hydraulic Carbon Fiber Tripod Kit (Origin Series) 4259

SmallRig x Potato Jet TRIBEX Hydraulic Carbon Fiber Tripod Kit (Origin Series) 4259 is designed for professional outdoor videography, offering swift and convenient operation. Featuring X-Clutch hydraulic technology, squeezing a single clutch allows all legs to rapidly unfold, adjust the angle, and automatically lock in just one second, providing photographers with a seamless experience. The clutch can also be adjusted to 45° and 90° to accommodate various shooting scenarios. Constructed with carbon fiber, both the legs and center column ensure lightweight design while delivering exceptional stability and high load-bearing capacity. Operating altitude ranges from 27cm (10.6in) to 168cm (66.1in), and a compact storage length of 79cm (31.1in). The center column features a quick-lock design for easy height adjustments, with a detachable Allen wrench built into the other side of the hook for convenient camera equipment assembly/disassembly, and the option for low-angle shooting at a minimum height of 27cm (10.6in). The compact design of the tripod allows it to fit in any standard luggage (28"").

The kit includes a compact and lightweight hydraulic fluid head featuring an adjustable 4-step counterbalance system. When the gravitational center height is set at 55mm (2.2 inches), the 4-step counterbalance system effectively stabilizes cameras or other equipment (up to 6kg / 13.2lbs) while providing precise control over camera tilt. The fluid head allows seamless, stepless adjustments for tilt and pan damping, catering to filmmakers' varying shooting preferences. The fluid head adopts a new Touch-and-Go quick-release mount plate design which does not require alignment and is more efficient than traditional slide-in plates. The plate is compatible with 501 quick-release plates and DJI RS series quick-release plates, facilitating swift transitions between stabilizers and tripods during filming. The user-friendly detachable telescopic handle enables easy control of the head when attached to either the left or right side, ensuring compatibility with any grip. The fluid head also features three 1/4""-20 threaded holes for attaching accessories like magic arms, along with a built-in flat head screw for convenient camera installation and removal. The tripod also includes quick-release rubber feet with integrated spikes, allowing for seamless adaptation to various terrains.

Note:

1. Before shooting, make sure the head and tripod locking status are in normal condition.

2. Avoid use in sandy or dusty environments to prevent the risk of damage.

3. After using the short center column, mounted on the center column, need to ensure the locking status.

4. Max payload of head: 6kg / 13.2lb (center column raised, leg angle at 23°, height at 168cm / 66.1in).

5. The weight capacity of the tripod head is not the absolute limit; it varies depending on the type of equipment, lenses used, accessories attached, and changes in the center of gravity.

6. Max payload of tripod: 25kg / 55lbs (center column not raised, tripod head detached, leg angle at 23°, height at 141cm / 55.5in).

7. After soaking in water, it needs to be dried before use.

SmallRig RT25 Handheld Tube Light with Battery Handle Grip 4342

Thanks to the quick-release design, you can seamlessly connect the tube light, battery grip, and lighting control accessories for wireless lighting on the go, significantly boosting efficiency. When compacted, the tube light is a mere 42cm / 16.5in long, with the handle weighing just 900g / 31.7oz, making it 75% lighter than comparable products. The lightweight design allows for effortless storage in any camera backpack or toolbox, ensuring swift and convenient transportation. The device offers various power supply solutions, including a built-in 45Wh battery handle that delivers up to 2 hours of continuous full-power usage on a single charge. Furthermore, both the light stick and handle are equipped with USB-C ports for PD fast charging, enabling uninterrupted shooting while powering up.

The versatile mounting options allow for handheld lighting using the handle or other setups connected via 1/4"" and 3/8"" standard ARRI locating pins, NATO rails, and other interfaces for easy installation and flexible lighting configurations. Its distinctive triangular cross-section lanyard design improves ergonomics, minimizing fatigue during prolonged handheld use and preventing accidental drops when placed on a flat surface. Even with a 0.5m/5600K setup and a PC diffuser, the light maintains an illuminance of 2,350lux, excelling in color accuracy with a CRI Ra of 96+ and TLCI of 98+. The color deviation (△UV) ranges between -0.0005 to +0.0005 at 2700K and 5600K, ensuring professional color performance and accurate reproduction of natural daylight.

The tube light boasts an anodized aluminum alloy body and a spacious curved PC diffuser, with the handle crafted from a robust blend of PC and ABS covered with silicone coating to ensure durability, effective heat dissipation, and silent operation. With meticulous craftsmanship, it holds an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance, making it suitable for challenging outdoor shooting conditions and unforeseen situations during night shooting. The soft, uniform light with a broad beam angle is perfect for capturing seamless and elegant moments in portrait photography. Featuring versatile adjustment knobs, dedicated control buttons, and a 0.96"" OLED screen, you can precisely and swiftly fine-tune light settings including bi-color light, RGB, special effects, color modes, preset modes to simulate 2500K-10000K daylight, 36000 RGB colors, 18 common special effects, and 8 common color filters. Additionally, it supports quick switching between 5 preset parameters.

The unique adjustable clamp design of the matte box features a three-point locking system, allowing for quick assembly and disassembly by pressing the push rods on both sides of the clamp and a locking knob on top. With an adjustable clamp range of 67.0 - 82.0mm (2.6 - 3.2in), it offers broad compatibility with popular mirrorless and cinema lenses.

6. The VND does not have clear gear markings.

SmallRig RC 100B COB LED Video Light (Standard Version) 4893

SmallRig RC 100B COB LED Video Light (Standard Version) 4893 is the latest addition to SmallRig's  Portable COB LED Video Light Ecosystem. This new light features a consistent cubic design, and an efficient cooling system independently developed by SmallRig.  The palm-sized RC 100B COB LED video light is only one-third the size of a traditional COB LED video light and is very close to the RED KOMODO in size, weighing just 700g or 24.7oz. Its compact design allows for easy storage and transport, making it particularly suitable for on-the-go photography and video content creation.

The light supports a variety of wireless and wired power options. Users can opt for V-mount batteries or NP-F970 batteries for wireless power supply, charge the device through a USB-C port with accessories like battery grip handles, PD fast charging power bank and charging plug, or AC to DC power adaptor. A single 98Wh V mount battery provides about an hour of full power, enabling uninterrupted shooting with quick battery changes.

The light offers both wireless and manual control modes for efficient light management. Wireless light control can be achieved through the SmallGoGo application. It is also compatible with DMX wired control manually when used with a DMX adapter (sold separately). Additionally, manual adjustments are possible via a 1.3-inch LCD screen, which is complemented by two individual knobs on the side of the device.

The Chip-on-Board light source features a patented high Color Rendering Index (CRI) for exceptional illumination and color accuracy. At a distance of 1m / 39.4in, the bare light source provides illumination of 4,610Lux at 5600K, which can be increased to 20,100Lux with the 45° mini hyper reflector. With a CRI of 97+, TLCI of 98+, SSI (3200K) of 91, and TM-30 (3200K) Rf/ Rg reaching 97/102, the light offers professional color performance, precise calibration, and accurate reproduction of natural daylight.

The body is made of V-0 flame retardant PC+ABS and reinforced with metal parts at the base, reducing weight by 30% compared to full aluminum alloy bodies while ensuring durability for frequent use.

The light features built-in cool and warm light adjust, special effects adjust, and preset modes, allowing simulation of 2700K-6500K sunlight with 12 common special effects. It also supports 4 sets of preset parameters for quick access and application of specific lighting settings.

It comes with a comprehensive range of accessories, fully compatible with SmallRig's mini-mount modifiers (D30, D60, 45x45 softbox) / battery accessories (V mount and NP-F970 batteries, universal battery grip handle for COB lights) / mounting accessories (light stand adaptor, Bowen's mount adapter part, 1/4""-20 with ARRI locating pins magic arm), providing users with a one-stop solution for portability, convenient power supply, easy control, high-quality light source, and comprehensive accessory ecosystem.

Usage Scenarios: Ideal for content creation, including photography (anime Convention, event,  travel, and wedding photography) as well as video content creation (YouTube channel episodes, interviews, documentaries, music video production, TV commercials, and live streaming).

Note: After using the equipment, the COB LED beads, panel area, top, and bottom of the device are all high-temperature zones. Avoid touching these high-temperature areas before the device has cooled down. For your safety and well-being, do not block the heat dissipation holes while using this device, and avoid prolonged direct exposure to the COB LED beads during operation.

Compact and lightweight, the palm-sized RC 100B is only one-third the size of traditional COB LED lights, closely resembling the RED KOMODO, and weighs just 700g (24.7oz). This design facilitates easy storage and transport, making it ideal for on-the-go shooting.

Equipped with a Chip-on-Board light source, the RC 100B boasts a patented high Color Rendering Index (CRI) for exceptional illumination and color accuracy. At a distance of 1m (39.4in), it delivers 4,610 Lux at 5600K, which can be boosted to 20,100 Lux with the 45° mini reflector. With a CRI of 97+, a TLCI of 98+, an SSI (3200K) of 91, and TM-30 (3200K) Rf/Rg values of 97/102, this light ensures professional-grade color rendering and accurate reproduction of natural daylight. It also features cool and warm light options, special effects, and preset modes, simulating sunlight from 2700K to 6500K with 12 special effects. Users can quickly access four sets of preset parameters for specific lighting settings.

Control options include wireless operation through the SmallGoGo app or DMX wired control with a separate adapter. Manual adjustments are facilitated by a 1.44-inch LCD color screen and two independent knobs.

The light offers versatile power options, allowing for wireless operation with either V-mount or NP-F970 batteries. It can also be charged via a USB-C port using accessories such as a power handle, PD power bank, or charging cable, as well as an AC to DC power adapter. Contains SH73 Grip Handle Designed Powerbank, which can support up to 45 minutes of runtime at maximum output, ensuring uninterrupted shooting with quick battery swaps.

Constructed from V-0 flame-retardant PC+ABS and reinforced with metal at the base, the light is 30% lighter than full aluminum alloy bodies while maintaining durability for frequent use.

A comprehensive range of accessories is included, fully compatible with SmallRig's mini-mount lighting modifiers (D30, D60, 45x45 softbox), battery accessories (V-mount and NP-F970 batteries, universal power handle for COB lights), and mounting accessories (light stand adapter, Bowens mount adapters, magic arm with 1/4""-20 ARRI locating pins). This provides users with a one-stop solution for portability, convenient power supply, easy control, high-quality light source, and a complete accessory ecosystem.

Usage Scenarios: Perfect for content creation, including photography at anime conventions, events, travel, and weddings, as well as video production for YouTube episodes, interviews, documentaries, music videos, TV commercials, and live streaming.

Note: After operation, the COB LED beads, panel area, and both the top and bottom of the device may become hot. To ensure safety, please refrain from touching these areas until they have cooled down. Additionally, avoid obstructing the heat dissipation holes during use, and do not stare directly at the COB LED beads for extended periods.
